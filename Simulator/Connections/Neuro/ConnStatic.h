 *
 * The small-world networks are regular networks rewired to introduce increasing amounts
 * of disorder, which can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small
 * characterisic path length, like random graphs. 
 *
 * The structural properties of these graphs are quantified by their characteristic path
 * length \f$L(p)\f$ and clustering coefficient \f$C(p)\f$. Here \f$L\f$ is defined as the number of edges
 * in the shortest path between two vertices, average over all pairs of vertices.
 * The clustering coefficient \f$C(p)\f$ is defined as follows. Suppose that a vertex \f$v\f$ has \f$k_v\f$
 * neighbours; then at most \f$k_v (k_v - 1) / 2\f$ edges can exist between them (this occurs when
 * every neighbour of \f$v\f$ is connected to every other neighbour of \f$v\f$).
 * Let \f$C_v\f$ denote the fracion of these allowable edges that actually exist.
 * Define \f$C\f$ as the avarage of \f$C_v\f$ over all \f$v\f$ (Watts etal. 1998).
 *
 * We first create a regular network characterised by two parameters: number of maximum 
 * connections per neurons and connection radius threshold, then rewire it according 
 * to the small-world rewiring probability.

 * Some models in this simulator is a rewrite of CSIM (2006) and other
 * work (Stiber and Kawasaki (2007?))
